Projekktor is a free open source multi media player for embedding audio- and video- content to any website - based on single files or on multiple ones bundled through playlists (webTV).

Its focus is to make the free open media formats Theora, Vorbis and WebM available on as many browser platforms as possible to keep encoding- and distribution costs as low as possible.
It mainly makes use of HTML, CSS and JS while featuring as less adobe flash as possible (just for fallback) to allow customization by a modicum of effort.

Its plugin API allows everyone to implement additional functionality such as ads and overlays to the mainscreen.
